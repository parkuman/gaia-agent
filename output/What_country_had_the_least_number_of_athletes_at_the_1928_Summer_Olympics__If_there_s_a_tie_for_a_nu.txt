{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_participating_nations_at_the_Summer_Olympic_Games\" page=\"\"/>\nThis is a list of nations, as represented by National Olympic Committees (NOCs), that have participated in the Summer Olympic Games between 1896 and 2024. As of the 2024 Games, all of the current 206 NOCs have participated in at least two editions of the Olympic Games. Athletes from Australia,a  France,[K] Great Britain, Greece, Italy,[R] and Switzerland[M] have competed in all thirty Summer Olympic Games.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nEarly Games were not clearly documented with respect to participating nations. Competitors from 11 to 16 nation participated in the inaugural 1896 Games, in Athens. Eleven nations (Australia, Austria, Denmark, Great Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States) are mentioned in the official report for the Games, and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) states that 14 nations were represented.\nThe NOCs for Bulgaria and Chile each claim that they were represented by a single athlete in Athens. Other sources also list Egypt, Italy, and the Turkish Empire.\n\nWhile official report was actually the summary of the sporting events held at the 1900 Exposition Universelle and so can not be considered as reliable source, the IOC states that 24 nations participated in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but additional sources list up to 28 nations, with Haiti, Iran, Luxembourg, and Peru being the additions.\nThe 1904 Games, held in St. Louis were the first Olympics outside of Europe, with very few top-class athletes from outside the North America taking part, and saw the participation of 12 to 15 nations, including a not yet existing Union of South Africa represented by a Boer team of extras from the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.\nAlthough the Intercalated Games of 1906 are no longer considered official Games of the Olympiad by the IOC, they helped restore the Olympic movement. Participation at subsequent Games grew steadily, with 22 nations in London for 1908 and 28 nations in Stockholm for the 1912 Games.\nAt these two Games (only), one of the delegations was actually a combined team of athletes from Australia and New Zealand, designated Australasia.\nThe Games of 1916, planned for Berlin, were cancelled due to World War I.\n\n\n=== Inter-war years ===\nAfter the First World War, the Olympic Games resumed in 1920, in Antwerp. Twenty-nine nations participated, but not Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, or Turkey, none of which were invited because of their roles in the war. Several newly created European states, such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, made their Olympic debut.\nThe Games grew rapidly for the 1924 Summer Olympics, in Paris, with 44 nations present,\neven though Germany was still not invited back to the Games. This situation would change for the 1928 Games where Germany returned to join a total of 46 participating nations.\nCompetitors from 37 nations travelled to Los Angeles for the 1932 Summer Olympics.\nThe 1936 Summer Olympics, in Berlin, were attended by 49 nations (a new high) but were highly politicized.\nThe scheduled Games of 1940 in Tokyo or Helsinki and 1944 in London were each cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II in 1939.\n\n\n=== Post-war years and Cold War era ===\n\nTwelve years after the previous Games, the 1948 Summer Olympics, in London, attracted competitors from 59 nations, including 14 that made their Olympic debut; once again, Germany was not invited to take part, and neither was Japan. The 1952 Games, in Helsinki, again set a new high, with 69 nations participating, including the first appearance by the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China and the return of Germany and Japan. The 1956 Summer Olympics, attended by 67 nations in Melbourne, were the first to be marred by a boycott. Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon withdrew in response to the Suez Crisis, and the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland withdrew in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Because of Australian quarantine restrictions, the equestrian events were he\n</Document>\n\n---\n\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table\" page=\"\"/>\nThe all-time medal table  for all Olympic Games from 1896 to 2024, including Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games, and a combined total of both, is tabulated below. These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.\nThe IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes unofficial tables only per single Games. This table was thus compiled by adding up single entries from the IOC database.\nThe results are attributed to the IOC country code as currently displayed by the IOC database. Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors.\n\n\n== List of NOCs with medals (sortable & unranked) ==\nThe table is pre-sorted by the name of each Olympic Committee, but can be displayed as sorted by any other column, such as the total number of gold medals or total number of overall medals. To sort by gold, silver, and then bronze, sort first by the bronze column, then the silver, and then the gold. The table does not count revoked medals (e.g., due to doping).\nA total of 162 current and historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2024 Summer Olympics, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 11 August 2024 are taken into account.\nAs of completion of the 2022 Winter Olympics, 12 National Olympic Committees have participated on a standalone basis in all 24 Winter Olympic Games. As of completion of the 2024 Summer Olympics, four National Olympic Committees have participated on a standalone basis in all 30 Summer Olympic Games, with five other NOCs missing a perfect participation record due the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. Of the combined 54 Olympic Games, only France, Great Britain and Switzerland have a 100% participation rate.\n\nThe sum total of gold, silver, and bronze medals are not equal for the following reasons:\n\nSome sports (such as boxing, judo, karate, taekwondo, and wrestling) award or have previously awarded two bronze medals per competition.\nTeam sports medals, such as in football or basketball count as one, even if there are multiple players on each team, who get a medal.\nSome tied performances have resulted in multiple medals of the same colour being awarded for an event. If this tie is for gold or silver, there will be a consequent absence of a silver or bronze medal for that event.\nSome medals that have been revoked have not been re-awarded.\nSome early events, such as cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics, had only two entrants.\nRetroactively awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals for the 1896 and 1900 games results in some anomalies, such as the 100 metre freestyle swimming event in 1896 where no surviving records distinguish the places of those who finished between 3rd and 10th position.\n\n\n== List of NOCs without medals (sortable & unranked) ==\nAfter completion of the 2024 Summer Olympics, 64 of the current 206 National Olympic Committees have yet to win an Olympic medal. Seven historic National Olympic Committees are also included in this list.\n\n\n== List of defunct historical NOCs and special delegations with medals (sortable & unranked) ==\n\n\n=== Defunct historical NOCs with medals ===\nA total of 10 defunct historical NOCs have earned at least one medal.\n\n\n=== Special delegations with medals ===\nAs of completion of the 2024 Summer \n</Document>"}

{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1928_Summer_Olympics_medal_table\" page=\"\"/>\nThis 1928 Summer Olympics medal table comprises two tables of countries ranked by the number of medals won during the 1928 Summer Olympics.\nThe 1928 Summer Olympics were held in and around Amsterdam in the Netherlands from 17 May 1928 to 22 August 1928. A total of 2,883 athletes from 46 countries participated in the sports competition, in 14 sports and 109 events. Additionally, five art competitions were held with 13 events combined. 327 sports medals and 29 arts medals were awarded during the 1928 Summer Olympics. A total of 5,901 souvenir medals were given; 5,139 medals to contestants and officials, and 762 medals to persons that contributed to the Olympics by rendering their services. The souvenir medals are not displayed in the medal tables.\n\n\n== Sports competition ==\n\nThe medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.\nFor the 109 sports events a total of 327 medals were awarded: 110 gold medals, 108 silver medals, and 109 bronze medals. These numbers are unequal, because two gold medals and no silver medals were awarded in the lightweight category of weightlifting, after a first-place tie in the event. The athletes of 33 countries won one or more medals. The most medals (56) and the most gold medals (22) were won by athletes from the United States.\nThe countries are ranked by the number of gold medals won by the athletes of that country. If countries are tied, first the number of silver medals is taken into consideration and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.\n\nMedal table does not include art competition medals\n  *   Host nation (Netherlands)\nSource: www.olympic.org\n\n\n== Arts competition ==\n\nThe ranking of the 1928 arts competitions is based on the official report The Ninth Olympiad (1928) of the Dutch National Olympic Committee. Art competitions were held during the Olympic Games from 1912 until 1948.\nFor the 13 arts events a total of 29 medals were awarded: 9 golden medals, 10 silver medals, and 10 bronze medals. These numbers are inequal, because not for all events three medals were awarded. There was only a silver medal awarded for dramatic works in literature and only a bronze medal for composition for orchestra in music. And also in music, no medals were awarded for compositions for song and composition for one instrument. The most medals (8) were won by contestants from Germany, the most gold medals (2) were won by contestants from the Netherlands.\nThe countries are ranked by the number of gold medals won by the athletes of that country. If countries are tied, first the number of silver medals is taken into consideration and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.\n\n  *   Host nation (Netherlands)\nSource: The Ninth Olympiad (1928)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Amsterdam 1928\".

Norman Pritchard represented the country and won two medals, both silver, in athletics. The nation first sent a team to the Summer Olympic Games in 1920 and has participated in every Summer Games since then. India has competed at several Winter Olympic Games after its debut in 1964.\nIndian athletes have won 41 medals, all at the Summer Games. At a period of time during the 1900s, the Indian men's field hockey team was dominant in the Olympic Games, winning eleven medals in twelve Olympics between 1928 and 1980 including eight gold medals of which six were won consecutively from 1928 to 1956. India's best performance happened at the 2020 Games, with seven medals including a gold and two silver.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before independence ===\n\nIndia made its first appearance at the 1900 Summer Olympics as part of British India (1858–1947), becoming the first Asian nation to participate in the Olympic Games. A lone athlete Norman Pritchard represented the country and won two silver medals in athletics. India was classified 19th in the overall medal table, which represents its best placement till date. India did not compete in the next three Summer Olympic Games. At the behest of then Governor of Bombay George Lloyd, Indian businessman Dorabji Tata secured representation for British India at the International Olympic Committee, enabling it to independently participate in the 1920 Summer Olympics. India sent a contingent of six competitors including four athletes and two wrestlers with two support staff. The Indian Olympic movement was then established during the 1920s. In 1923, a provisional All India Olympic Committee was formed, and in February 1924, the All India Olympic Games (later National Games of India) were held to select a team for the 1924 Summer Olympics at Paris. The Indian delegation at the Paris Olympics consisted of 14 competitors including eight in athletics and four in tennis, led by team manager Harry Buck.\n\nIn 1927, the provisional Indian Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee and formally became the Indian Olympic Association (IOA). The organization was formed to promote the development of sports in India, host the national games, and select teams for the Olympics. For the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, it selected eight competitors, which included seven in athletics and one swimmer. The Indian Hockey Federation, which had been established earlier in 1925, sent the men's team to the 1928 Games. The hockey team won India's first gold medal in the Olympics at Amsterdam. This was the first gold medal won by any nation from Asia at the modern Olympic Games. For the 1932 Games, the Indian contingent consisted of the field hockey team and five athletes. For the subsequent 1936 Games, India sent a contingent consisting of the field hockey team and eight athletes, who competed in four sports. The only medals in the last two Games came from the Indian field hockey team, which won three consecutive gold medals from 1928 to 1936. The victory run included the largest victory margin in Olympics history after India defeated United States 24–1 in 1932 and the largest margin of victory in an Olympic final during the 8–1 defeat of Germany in the final in 1936.\n\n\n=== After independence ===\n\nIndia gained its independence in 1947, it sent its first contingent as an independent country for the 1948 Summer Olympics held at London. The Indian contingent consisted of 79 athletes, who competed across ten sports and included country's first participation in arts, boxing, cycling, football, and water polo events. The Indian field hockey team won the lone medal, a gold, which was the first medal for India as an independent nation. The 1952 Summer Olympics marked the first time India sent women competitors to the Games. The Indian contingent consisted of 64 competitors including four women with first time par\n</Document>"}
