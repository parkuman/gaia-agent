{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games\" page=\"\"/>\nThe Summer Olympic Games, also known as the Summer Olympics or the Games of the Olympiad, is a major international multi-sport event normally held once every four years. The inaugural Games took place in 1896 in Athens, then part of the Kingdom of Greece, and the most recent was held in 2024 in Paris, France. This was the first international multi-sport event of its kind, organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) founded by Pierre de Coubertin. The tradition of awarding medals began in 1904; in each Olympic event, gold medals are awarded for first place, silver medals for second place, and bronze medals for third place. The Winter Olympic Games were created out of the success of the Summer Olympic Games, which are regarded as the largest and most prestigious multi-sport international event in the world.\nThe Summer Olympics have increased in scope from a 42-event competition programme in 1896 with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations, to 339 events in 2021 with 11,420 competitors (almost half of whom were women) from 206 nations. The Games have been held in nineteen countries over five continents: four times in the United States (1904, 1932, 1984, and 1996), three times in Great Britain (1908, 1948, and 2012) and in France (1900, 1924, and 2024), twice each in Greece (1896 and 2004), Germany (1936 and 1972), Australia (1956 and 2000), and Japan (1964 and 2020), and once each in Sweden (1912), Belgium (1920), the Netherlands (1928), Finland (1952), Italy (1960), Mexico (1968), Canada (1976), Russia (1980), South Korea (1988), Spain (1992), China (2008), and Brazil (2016).\nLondon and Paris have hosted three times, Los Angeles, Athens, and Tokyo have each hosted twice; Los Angeles will host the Games for the third time in 2028. Only five countries have participated in every Summer Olympic Games: Australia, France, Great Britain, Greece and Switzerland. Australia, France and Great Britain have won at least a medal at every edition of the Games, with Great Britain as the only one that never failed to win at least a gold medal. The United States leads the all-time medal count for the Summer Olympics, and has topped the medal table on 19 separate occasions—followed by the USSR (seven times, including the 1992 'Unified Team'), and France, Great Britain, Germany and China (once each).\n\n\n== Hosting ==\n\nThe United States hosted the Summer Olympic Games four times: the 1904 Games were held in St. Louis, Missouri; the 1932 and 1984 Games were both held in Los Angeles, California, and the 1996 Games were held in Atlanta, Georgia. The 2028 Games in Los Angeles will mark the fifth occasion on which the Summer Games have been hosted by the U.S.\nIn 2012, London hosted its third Summer Olympic Games and became the first city ever to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games three times, which then followed by Paris in 2024. The cities of Los Angeles, Tokyo and Athens (excluding 1906) have each hosted two Summer Olympic Games. In 2028, Los Angeles will in turn become the third city ever to have hosted the Games three times.\nAustralia, Germany, Greece and Japan all hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice (with Australia planned to host in 2032, therefore taking it to three). Tokyo, Japan, hosted the 2020 Games and became the first city outside the predominantly English-speaking and European nations to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having already hosted the Games in 1964; it is also the largest city ever to have hosted, having grown considerably since 1964. The other countries to have hosted the Summer Olympics are Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, South Korea, Soviet Union, Spain, and Sweden, with each of these countries having hosted the Summer Games on one occasion.\nAsia has hosted the Summer Olympics four times: in Tokyo (1964 and 2020), Seoul (1988), and Beijing (2008).\nThe 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were the first Summer Olympics to be held in South America and the first t\n</Document>\n\n---\n\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_participating_nations_at_the_Summer_Olympic_Games\" page=\"\"/>\nThis is a list of nations, as represented by National Olympic Committees (NOCs), that have participated in the Summer Olympic Games between 1896 and 2024. As of the 2024 Games, all of the current 206 NOCs have participated in at least two editions of the Olympic Games. Athletes from Australia,a  France,[K] Great Britain, Greece, Italy,[R] and Switzerland[M] have competed in all thirty Summer Olympic Games.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nEarly Games were not clearly documented with respect to participating nations. Competitors from 11 to 16 nation participated in the inaugural 1896 Games, in Athens. Eleven nations (Australia, Austria, Denmark, Great Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States) are mentioned in the official report for the Games, and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) states that 14 nations were represented.\nThe NOCs for Bulgaria and Chile each claim that they were represented by a single athlete in Athens. Other sources also list Egypt, Italy, and the Turkish Empire.\n\nWhile official report was actually the summary of the sporting events held at the 1900 Exposition Universelle and so can not be considered as reliable source, the IOC states that 24 nations participated in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but additional sources list up to 28 nations, with Haiti, Iran, Luxembourg, and Peru being the additions.\nThe 1904 Games, held in St. Louis were the first Olympics outside of Europe, with very few top-class athletes from outside the North America taking part, and saw the participation of 12 to 15 nations, including a not yet existing Union of South Africa represented by a Boer team of extras from the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.\nAlthough the Intercalated Games of 1906 are no longer considered official Games of the Olympiad by the IOC, they helped restore the Olympic movement. Participation at subsequent Games grew steadily, with 22 nations in London for 1908 and 28 nations in Stockholm for the 1912 Games.\nAt these two Games (only), one of the delegations was actually a combined team of athletes from Australia and New Zealand, designated Australasia.\nThe Games of 1916, planned for Berlin, were cancelled due to World War I.\n\n\n=== Inter-war years ===\nAfter the First World War, the Olympic Games resumed in 1920, in Antwerp. Twenty-nine nations participated, but not Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, or Turkey, none of which were invited because of their roles in the war. Several newly created European states, such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, made their Olympic debut.\nThe Games grew rapidly for the 1924 Summer Olympics, in Paris, with 44 nations present,\neven though Germany was still not invited back to the Games. This situation would change for the 1928 Games where Germany returned to join a total of 46 participating nations.\nCompetitors from 37 nations travelled to Los Angeles for the 1932 Summer Olympics.\nThe 1936 Summer Olympics, in Berlin, were attended by 49 nations (a new high) but were highly politicized.\nThe scheduled Games of 1940 in Tokyo or Helsinki and 1944 in London were each cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II in 1939.\n\n\n=== Post-war years and Cold War era ===\n\nTwelve years after the previous Games, the 1948 Summer Olympics, in London, attracted competitors from 59 nations, including 14 that made their Olympic debut; once again, Germany was not invited to take part, and neither was Japan. The 1952 Games, in Helsinki, again set a new high, with 69 nations participating, including the first appearance by the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China and the return of Germany and Japan. The 1956 Summer Olympics, attended by 67 nations in Melbourne, were the first to be marred by a boycott. Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon withdrew in response to the Suez Crisis, and the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland withdrew in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Because of Australian quarantine restrictions, the equestrian events were he\n</Document>"}

{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_at_the_Olympics\" page=\"\"/>\nIndia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1900, becoming the first Asian nation to do so. Norman Pritchard represented the country and won two medals, both silver, in athletics. The nation first sent a team to the Summer Olympic Games in 1920 and has participated in every Summer Games since then. India has competed at several Winter Olympic Games after its debut in 1964.\nIndian athletes have won 41 medals, all at the Summer Games. At a period of time during the 1900s, the Indian men's field hockey team was dominant in the Olympic Games, winning eleven medals in twelve Olympics between 1928 and 1980 including eight gold medals of which six were won consecutively from 1928 to 1956. India's best performance happened at the 2020 Games, with seven medals including a gold and two silver.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before independence ===\n\nIndia made its first appearance at the 1900 Summer Olympics as part of British India (1858–1947), becoming the first Asian nation to participate in the Olympic Games. A lone athlete Norman Pritchard represented the country and won two silver medals in athletics. India was classified 19th in the overall medal table, which represents its best placement till date. India did not compete in the next three Summer Olympic Games. At the behest of then Governor of Bombay George Lloyd, Indian businessman Dorabji Tata secured representation for British India at the International Olympic Committee, enabling it to independently participate in the 1920 Summer Olympics. India sent a contingent of six competitors including four athletes and two wrestlers with two support staff. The Indian Olympic movement was then established during the 1920s. In 1923, a provisional All India Olympic Committee was formed, and in February 1924, the All India Olympic Games (later National Games of India) were held to select a team for the 1924 Summer Olympics at Paris. The Indian delegation at the Paris Olympics consisted of 14 competitors including eight in athletics and four in tennis, led by team manager Harry Buck.\n\nIn 1927, the provisional Indian Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee and formally became the Indian Olympic Association (IOA). The organization was formed to promote the development of sports in India, host the national games, and select teams for the Olympics. For the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, it selected eight competitors, which included seven in athletics and one swimmer. The Indian Hockey Federation, which had been established earlier in 1925, sent the men's team to the 1928 Games. The hockey team won India's first gold medal in the Olympics at Amsterdam. This was the first gold medal won by any nation from Asia at the modern Olympic Games. For the 1932 Games, the Indian contingent consisted of the field hockey team and five athletes. For the subsequent 1936 Games, India sent a contingent consisting of the field hockey team and eight athletes, who competed in four sports. The only medals in the last two Games came from the Indian field hockey team, which won three consecutive gold medals from 1928 to 1936. The victory run included the largest victory margin in Olympics history after India defeated United States 24–1 in 1932 and the largest margin of victory in an Olympic final during the 8–1 defeat of Germany in the final in 1936.\n\n\n=== After independence ===\n\nIndia gained its independence in 1947, it sent its first contingent as an independent country for the 1948 Summer Olympics held at London. The Indian contingent consisted of 79 athletes, who competed across ten sports and included country's first participation in arts, boxing, cycling, football, and water polo events. The Indian field hockey team won the lone medal, a gold, which was the first medal for India as an independent nation. The 1952 Summer Olympics marked the first time India sent women competitors to the Games. The Indian contingent consisted of 64 competitors including four women with first time par\n</Document>\n\n---\n\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines_at_the_1928_Summer_Olympics\" page=\"\"/>\nThe Philippines, also known as the Philippine Islands, competed at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Netherlands, which was held from May 17 to August 12. The country's participation in Amsterdam marked their second appearance at the Summer Olympics since their debut at the previous games in 1924, which were held in Paris, France.\nThe delegation was composed of eight people, including four competitors: sprinter Anselmo Gonzaga, high-jumper Simeon Toribio, and swimmers Tuburan Tamse and Teófilo Yldefonso. The non-competitors were attaché C. Boissevain, sports official J. Fruitt Maxwell, representative Costancio Alvarado, and medical officer Regino Ylanan. The team was planned by the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation and was made through tryouts held in February 1928.\nYldefonso, who competed in the men's 200 meter breaststroke, won the bronze medal in the event. His win earned the nation's first medal at any of the Olympic Games.\n\n\n== Medalists ==\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe 1928 Summer Olympics were held from May 17 to August 12, in Amsterdam, Netherlands. This edition of the games marked the nation's second appearance at the Summer Olympics since their debut at the last games, the 1924 Summer Olympics, which were held in Paris, France.\n\n\n=== Qualification and delegation ===\n\nThe delegation was organized by the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation, although the federation's recognition as the National Olympic Committee of the nation was in 1929. To be determined through tryouts in February 1928, the federation originally planned for five competitors to compete at the games. Selecting three competitors in athletics, a sprinter, a middle-distance runner, and a high jumper, and two competitors in swimming, however the federation was willing to include other competitors in the delegation if the competitors \"develop unexpected ability\" during the tryouts in other sports included in the program. It was also set that the men's national tennis team that competed at the 1928 International Lawn Tennis Challenge Europe Zone (commonly known as the Davis Cup), composed of Guillermo Aragon and Lope Yngayo, were to compete at the games as well. Tennis was removed from the program after the previous games.\nThe final delegation included eight people. The non-competitors were C. Boissevain, who served as the attaché, J. Fruitt Maxwell as an official in the athletics and swimming events, Costancio Alvarado as a representative, and Regino Ylanan as the medical officer of the team. The athletes that were included were: sprinter Anselmo Gonzaga, high-jumper Simeon Toribio, and swimmers Tuburan Tamse and Teófilo Yldefonso. Tamse was the first Filipino Muslim to compete at a games.\n\n\n=== Opening ceremony ===\nEach nation that entered at the Parade of Nations during the opening ceremony of the games were arranged according to their Dutch names, besides the delegations of Greece that came first and the Netherlands that came last. The Philippine delegation marched 32nd out of the 46 nations in the Parade of Nations within the opening ceremony. Anselmo Gonzaga held the flag for the delegation.\n\n\n== Athletics ==\n\nThe athletics events were held in the Olympic Stadium. Toribio first competed in the men's high jump on July 29, where he competed in the Group A of the qualifying stages and qualified for the finals with a jump of 1.83 meters, equaling first place. In the finals, he jumped a height of 1.91 meters and placed fourth after a jump-off. Although Toribio missed out on a medal due to his bad form, General Douglas MacArthur commented that Toribio had potential and that he would supply Toribio with a coach once he arrived in the Philippines.\nThe same day, Gonzaga competed in the sixteenth heat of the first round of the men's 100 meters, where he ran with an unknown time and placed second to qualify for the next round. He then competed in the fifth heat in the quarterfinals and failed to progress further with a disputed placement of fourth and an est\n</Document>"}
