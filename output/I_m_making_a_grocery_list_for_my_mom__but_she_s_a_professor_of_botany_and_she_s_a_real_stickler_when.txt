I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.

{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable\" page=\"\"/>\nVegetables are edible parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. This original meaning is still commonly used, and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An alternative definition is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition; it may include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses, but exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains.\nOriginally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first, plants that grew locally were cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought common and exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables, and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food, to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the crop is followed by grading, storing, processing, and marketing.\nVegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word vegetable was first recorded in English in the early 15th century. It comes from Old French, and was originally applied to all plants; the word is still used in this sense in biological contexts. It derives from Medieval Latin vegetabilis \"growing, flourishing\" (i.e. of a plant), a semantic change from a Late Latin meaning \"to be enlivening, quickening\".\nThe meaning of \"vegetable\" as a \"plant grown for food\" was not established until the 18th century. In 1767, the word was specifically used to mean a \"plant cultivated for food, an edible herb or root\". The year 1955 saw the first use of the shortened, slang term \"veggie\".\nAs an adjective, the word vegetable is used in scientific and technical contexts with a different and much broader meaning, namely of \"related to plants\" in general, edible or not—as in vegetable matter, vegetable kingdom, vegetable origin, etc.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe exact definition of \"vegetable\" may vary simply because of the many parts of a plant consumed as food worldwide—roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. The broadest definition is the word's use adjectivally to mean \"matter of plant origin\". More specifically, a vegetable may be defined as \"any plant, part of which is used for food\", a secondary meaning then being \"the edible part of such a plant\". A more precise definition is \"any plant part consumed for food that is not a fruit or seed, but including mature fruits that are eaten as part of a main meal\". Falling outside these definitions are edible fungi (such as edible mushrooms) and edible seaweed which, although not parts of plants, are often treated as vegetables.\n\nIn the latter-mentioned definition of \"vegetable\", which is used in everyday language, the words \"fruit\" and \"vegetable\" are mutually exclusive. \"Fruit\" has a precise botanical meaning, being a part that developed from the ovary of a flowering plant. This is considerably different from the word's culinary meaning. While peaches, plums, and oranges are \"fruit\" in both senses, many items commonly called \"vegetables\", such as eggplants, bell peppers, and\n</Document>\n\n---\n\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil\" page=\"\"/>\nVegetable oils, or vegetable fats, are oils extracted from seeds or from other parts of edible plants. Like animal fats, vegetable fats are mixtures of triglycerides. Soybean oil, grape seed oil, and cocoa butter are examples of seed oils, or fats from seeds. Olive oil, palm oil, and rice bran oil are examples of fats from other parts of plants. In common usage, vegetable oil may refer exclusively to vegetable fats which are liquid at room temperature. Vegetable oils are usually edible.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== In antiquity ===\nOlive oil has been a part of human culture for millennia. Archaeological evidence shows that olives were turned into olive oil by 6000 BC and 4500 BC in present-day Israel. Pagnol, p. 19, says the 6th millennium in Jericho, but cites no source. In ancient Egypt, plant oils including cedar oil, cypress oil, and olive oil were used during the mummification process.\nVegetable oils have been used as lighting fuel for lamps, cooking, medicine and lubrication. Palm oil has long been recognized in West and Central African countries, and European merchants trading with West Africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use as a cooking oil in Europe. It became highly sought-after commodity by British traders for use as an industrial lubricant for machinery during Britain's Industrial Revolution.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nPalm oil formed the basis of soap products, such as Lever Brothers' (now Unilever) \"Sunlight\", and \nB. J. Johnson Company's (now Colgate-Palmolive) \"Palmolive,\" and by around 1870, palm oil constituted the primary export of some West African countries.\nIn 1780, Carl Wilhelm Scheele demonstrated that fats were derived from glycerol.  Thirty years later Michel Eugène Chevreul deduced that these fats were esters of fatty acids and glycerol. Wilhelm Normann, a German chemist, introduced the hydrogenation of liquid fats in 1901, creating what later became known as trans fats, leading to the development of the global production of margarine and vegetable shortening.\nIn the United States, cottonseed oil was developed, and marketed by Procter & Gamble as a creamed shortening – Crisco – as early as 1911. Ginning mills were happy to have someone haul away the cotton seeds. The extracted oil was refined and partially hydrogenated to give a solid at room temperature and thus mimic natural lard, and canned under nitrogen gas. Compared to the rendered lard Procter & Gamble was already selling to consumers, Crisco was cheaper, easier to stir into a recipe, and could be stored at room temperature for two years without turning rancid.\nSoybeans are protein-rich, and the medium viscosity oil rendered from them was high in polyunsaturates. Henry Ford established a soybean research laboratory, developed soybean plastics and a soy-based synthetic wool, and built a car \"almost entirely\" out of soybeans. Roger Drackett had a successful new product with Windex, but he invested heavily in soybean research, seeing it as a smart investment. By the 1950s and 1960s, soybean oil had become the most popular vegetable oil in the US; today it is second only to palm oil. In 2018–2019, world production was at 57.4 MT with the leading producers including China (16.6 MT), US (10.9 MT), Argentina (8.4 MT), Brazil (8.2 MT), and EU (3.2 MT).\nThe early 20th century also saw the start of the use of vegetable oil as a fuel in diesel engines and in heating oil burners. Rudolf Diesel designed his engine to run on vegetable oil. The idea, he hoped, would make his engines more attractive to farmers who had a source of fuel readily available. Diesel's first engine ran on its own power for the first time in Augsburg, Germany, on 10 August 1893  on nothing but peanut oil. In remembrance of this event, 10 August has been declared \"International Biodiesel Day\". The first patent on Biodiesel was granted in 1937. Periodic petroleum shortages spurred research into vegetable oil as a diesel substitute during the 1930s and 1940s, and again in the 1970s and e\n</Document>"}

{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit\" page=\"\"/>\nIn botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (angiosperms) that is formed from the ovary after flowering.\nFruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate their seeds. Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and other animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; humans, and many other animals, have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.\nIn common language and culinary usage, fruit normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet (or sour) and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. In botanical usage, the term fruit also includes many structures that are not commonly called as such in everyday language, such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.\n\n\n== Botanical vs. culinary ==\n\nMany common language terms used for fruit and seeds differ from botanical classifications. For example, in botany, a fruit is a ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds, e.g., an orange, pomegranate, tomato or a pumpkin. A nut is a type of fruit (and not a seed), and a seed is a ripened ovule.\nIn culinary language, a fruit is the sweet- or not sweet- (even sour-) tasting produce of a specific plant (e.g., a peach, pear or lemon); nuts are hard, oily, non-sweet plant produce in shells (hazelnut, acorn). Vegetables, so-called, typically are savory or non-sweet produce (zucchini, lettuce, broccoli, and tomato). but some may be sweet-tasting (sweet potato).\n\nExamples of botanically classified fruit that are typically called vegetables include cucumber, pumpkin, and squash (all are cucurbits); beans, peanuts, and peas (all legumes); and corn, eggplant, bell pepper (or sweet pepper), and tomato. Many spices are fruits, botanically speaking, including black pepper, chili pepper, cumin and allspice. In contrast, rhubarb is often called a fruit when used in making pies, but the edible produce of rhubarb is actually the leaf stalk or petiole of the plant. Edible gymnosperm seeds are often given fruit names, e.g., ginkgo nuts and pine nuts.\nBotanically, a cereal grain, such as corn, rice, or wheat is a kind of fruit (termed a caryopsis). However, the fruit wall is thin and fused to the seed coat, so almost all the edible grain-fruit is actually a seed.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe outer layer, often edible, of most fruits is called the pericarp. Typically formed from the ovary, it surrounds the seeds; in some species, however, other structural tissues contribute to or form the edible portion. The pericarp may be described in three layers from outer to inner, i.e., the epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp.\nFruit that bears a prominent pointed terminal projection is said to be beaked.\n\n\n== Development ==\nA fruit results from the fertilizing and maturing of one or more flowers. The gynoecium, which contains the stigma-style-ovary system, is centered in the flower-head, and it forms all or part of the fruit. Inside the ovary(ies) are one or more ovules. Here begins a complex sequence called double fertilization: a female gametophyte produces an egg cell for the purpose of fertilization. (A female gametophyte is called a megagametophyte, and also called the embryo sac.) After double fertilization, the ovules will become seeds.\nOvules are fertilized in a process that starts with pollination, which is the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma-style-ovary system within the flower-head. After pollination, a pollen tube grows from the (deposited) pollen through the stigma down the style into the ovary to the ovule. Two sperm are transferred from the pollen to a megagametophyte. Within the megagametophyt\n</Document>\n\n---\n\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passion_fruit_(fruit)\" page=\"\"/>\nThe passion fruit (Portuguese: maracujá and Spanish: maracuyá, both from the Tupi mara kuya, lit. \"fruit that serves itself\" or \"food in a cuia\") and granadilla is the fruit of several plants in the genus Passiflora. It is native to subtropical regions of South America from southern Brazil through Paraguay to northern Argentina. The fruit is eaten for its pulp and seeds, and as a juice. The name passion fruit derives from 18th century Christian missionaries who interpreted the flower as a religious symbol.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPassion fruits are round or oval, and range from a width of 1.5 to 3 inches (3.81 to 7.62 centimeters). They can be yellow, red, purple, or green.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n\n=== Maracujá ===\nThe Portuguese maracujá and Spanish maracuyá are both derived from the Tupi mara kuya \"fruit that serves itself\" or \"food in a cuia\". \n\n\n=== Passion fruit ===\nThe term \"passion fruit\" in English comes from the passion flower, as an English translation of the Latin genus name, Passiflora, and may be spelled \"passion fruit\", \"passionfruit\", or \"passion-fruit\". Around 1700, the name Passiflora was given by missionaries in Brazil as an educational aid to convert the Indigenous inhabitants to Christianity: its name was flor das cinco chagas or \"flower of the Five Wounds\" to illustrate the crucifixion of Christ and his resurrection, with other plant components also named after instruments of the Passion of Jesus.\n\n\n== Varieties ==\nEdible passion fruits can be divided into at least five main types:\n\npurple passion fruit (fruits of Passiflora edulis Sims)\nyellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa Deg.)\nsweet granadilla (Passiflora ligularis)\ngiant granadilla (Passiflora quadrangularis L.)\nbanana passion fruit (fruits of Passiflora tarminiana)\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe fruits are mainly consumed and have a juicy edible center of many seeds. The parts of the fruit eaten are the pulpy, juicy seeds. Passion fruits are commonly squeezed to make juice, or used for pastries and other baked products, and as an ice cream flavor.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\n\n=== Nutrition ===\nRaw passion fruit is 73% water, 23% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a reference amount of 100 g (3.5 oz), raw passion fruit supplies 97 calories and is a rich source of vitamin C (33% of the Daily Value, DV) and a moderate source of riboflavin and potassium (table). No other micronutrients are in significant content (table).\n\n\n=== Phytochemicals ===\nSeveral varieties of passion fruit are rich in polyphenols, and some contain prunasin and other cyanogenic glycosides in the peel and juice.\n\n\n== History ==\nPassion fruit originates from South America, specifically from the region stretching from southern Brazil through Paraguay to northern Argentina. The fruit has been cultivated since ancient times, primarily by Indigenous communities in these areas. It was later introduced to Europe in 1553 by Spanish and Portuguese colonists.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nFassionola\nPOG juice\n\n\n== References ==\n</Document>"}
