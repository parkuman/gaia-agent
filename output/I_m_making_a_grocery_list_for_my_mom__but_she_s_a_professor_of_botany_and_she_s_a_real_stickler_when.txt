I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:

milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts

I need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.

{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato\" page=\"\"/>\nThe sweet potato or sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) is a dicotyledonous plant in the morning glory family, Convolvulaceae. Its sizeable, starchy, sweet-tasting tuberous roots are used as a root vegetable, which is a staple food in parts of the world. Cultivars of the sweet potato have been bred to bear tubers with flesh and skin of various colors. Moreover, the young shoots and leaves are occasionally eaten as greens. The sweet potato and the potato are in the order Solanales, making them distant relatives. Although darker sweet potatoes are often known as \"yams\" in parts of North America, they are even more distant from actual yams, which are monocots in the order Dioscoreales.\nThe sweet potato is native to the tropical regions of South America in what is present-day Ecuador. Of the approximately 50 genera and more than 1,000 species of Convolvulaceae, I. batatas is the only crop plant of major importance—some others are used locally (e.g., I. aquatica \"kangkong\" as a green vegetable), but many are poisonous. The genus Ipomoea that contains the sweet potato also includes several garden flowers called morning glories, but that term is not usually extended to I. batatas. Some cultivars of I. batatas are grown as ornamental plants under the name tuberous morning glory, and used in a horticultural context. Sweet potatoes can also be called yams in North America. When soft varieties were first grown commercially there, there was a need to differentiate between the two. Enslaved Africans had already been calling the 'soft' sweet potatoes 'yams' because they resembled the unrelated yams in Africa. Thus, 'soft' sweet potatoes were referred to as 'yams' to distinguish them from the 'firm' varieties.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe plant is a herbaceous perennial vine, bearing alternate triangle-shaped or palmately lobed leaves and medium-sized sympetalous flowers. The stems are usually crawling on the ground and form adventitious roots at the nodes. The leaves are screwed along the stems. The leaf stalk is 13 to 51 centimetres (5 to 20 inches) long. The leaf blades are very variable, 5 to 13 cm (2 to 5 in) long, the shape is heart-, kidney- to egg-shaped, rounded or triangular and spear-shaped, the edge can be entire, toothed or often three to seven times lobed, cut or divided. Most of the leaf surfaces are bare, rarely hairy, and the tip is rounded to pointed. The leaves are mostly green in color, but the accumulation of anthocyanins, especially along the leaf veins, can make them purple. Depending on the variety, the total length of a stem can be between 0.5 and 4 metres (1+1⁄2 and 13 feet). Some cultivars also form shoots up to 16 m (52 ft) in length. However, these do not form underground storage organs.\nThe hermaphrodite, five-fold and short-stalked flowers are single or few in stalked, zymous inflorescences that arise from the leaf axils and stand upright. It produces flowers when the day is short. The small sepals are elongated and tapering to a point and spiky and (rarely only 7) 10 to 15 millimetres (3⁄8 to 5⁄8 in) long, usually finely haired or ciliate. The inner three are a little longer. The 4 to 7 cm (1+1⁄2 to 2+3⁄4 in) long, overgrown and funnel-shaped, folded crown, with a shorter hem, can be lavender to purple-lavender in color, the throat is usually darker in color, but white crowns can also appear. The enclosed stamens are of unequal length with glandular filaments. The two-chamber ovary is upper constant with a relatively short stylus. Seeds are only produced from cross-pollination.\nThe flowers open before sunrise and stay open for a few hours. They close again in the morning and begin to wither. The edible tuberous root is long and tapered, with a smooth skin whose color ranges between yellow, orange, red, brown, purple, and beige. Its flesh ranges from beige through white, red, pink, violet, yellow, orange, and purple. Sweet potato cultivars with white or pale yellow flesh are less sweet and moist than those with red, pink\n</Document>\n\n---\n\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato_pie\" page=\"\"/>\nSweet potato pie is a traditional dessert, originating in the Southern United States. It is often served during the American holiday season, especially at Thanksgiving and Christmas in place of pumpkin pie, which is more traditional in other regions of the United States. \nIt is made in an open pie shell without a top crust. The filling consists of mashed sweet potatoes; evaporated milk; sugar; spices such as cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg; and eggs. The baked custard filling may vary from light and silky to dense, depending on the recipe's ratio of sweet potato, milk and eggs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThough creamy vegetable pie recipes date back to Medieval Europe, sweet potato pie appears in the southern United States from the early colonial days. The use of sweet potatoes in Southern and African-American cuisine traces back to Native American cuisine. The sweet potato, which is native to the Americas, was likely used by enslaved Africans as an alternative to the yam found in their homeland. Sweet potato pie applies European pie making customs to the preparation of sweet potatoes. Recipes for sweet potato pie first appeared in printed cookbooks in the 18th century, where it was included with savory vegetable dishes. By the 19th century, sweet potato pie was more commonly classified as a dessert. American Heritage (magazine) declared sweet potato pie the nation's \"most underrated pie\" elaborating, \"That something as lowly and simple as this native plant could be transformed into such a glorious feast is a perfect characterization of the American ideal.\"\nOne variation is the Hawaiian sweet potato haupia pie.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of custard desserts\nPie in American cuisine\nList of pies, tarts and flans\nList of sweet potato dishes\nList of regional dishes of the United States\n Food portal\n\n\n== References ==\n</Document>"}

{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Margherita\" page=\"\"/>\nPizza Margherita, also known as Margherita pizza, is, together with the pizza marinara, the typical Neapolitan pizza. It is roundish in shape with a raised edge (the cornicione) and seasoned with hand-crushed peeled tomatoes, mozzarella (buffalo mozzarella or fior di latte), fresh basil leaves, and extra virgin olive oil. The dough is made by mixing water, salt, and yeast (either sourdough, or fresh or dry baker's yeast) with flour (00 or 0).\nThe dough is stretched by the pizzaiolo ('pizza maker') in a motion going outwards from the center, pressing with the fingers of both hands on the dough ball, and flipping it several times, shaping it into a disc. It is then topped and baked in an oven, which is traditionally made of brick and wood-fired (electric or gas ovens are also used). Pizza Margherita is usually served hot on a plate or folded into four and wrapped in paper (pizza a portafoglio or a libretto).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origins of pizza Margherita came from mixing similar toppings that were already present in Naples between 1796 and 1810. In 1849 Emanuele Rocco recorded different pizza toppings including basil, tomatoes, and thin slices of mozzarella; the mozzarella was thinly sliced, and added to the toppings already present.\nIn 1866, Francesco De Bourcard, writing about the Naples traditions, described the most commonly used pizza toppings at that time as well as the possible origin of calzone:\n\nThe most ordinary pizza, called coll'aglio e l'olio (lit. 'with garlic and oil'), is dressed with oil, and over it is spread, as well as salt, origanum, and garlic cloves shredded minutely (optionally). Others can be covered in grated cheese and dressed with lard, and then they put on a few leaves of basil. Over the former is often added (depending on the region) some small seafish; on the latter some thin slices of mozzarella. Sometimes they use slices of prosciutto, tomato, arselle, etc. Sometimes folding the dough over itself to form what is called calzone.\nA popular legend holds that the archetypal pizza Margherita was invented in June 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag—red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil). Supposedly, this type of pizza was then named after the queen, with an official letter of recognition from the queen's \"head of service\" remaining to this day on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.\n\nLater research cast doubt on this legend, undermining the authenticity of the letter of recognition, pointing that no media of the period reported about supposed visit and that both the story and name Margherita were first promoted in the 1930s–1940s.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n Media related to Pizza Margherita at Wikimedia Commons\n\nNeapolitan cuisine\nNeapolitan pizza\nPizza marinara\nList of pizza varieties by country\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDe Bourcard, Francesco (1866).

It is somewhat similar to the Ligurian sauce pesto, although it lacks pine nuts and cheese; some versions include cheese and/or almonds.\n\n\n== Etymology and history ==\nThe Dictionnaire de l'Académie française dates \"pistou\" from the 20th century, and defines it as a Provençal word denoting a condiment made from fresh basil, crushed with garlic and olive oil; the term derives from pistar (to grind) itself derived from the Latin pinsare (to pound, to grind).\nThe sauce is similar to Genoese pesto, which is traditionally made of garlic, basil, pine nuts, grated Sardinian pecorino, and olive oil, crushed and mixed with a mortar and pestle. The key difference between pistou and pesto is the absence of cheese in pistou.\n\n\n== Use ==\n\nPistou is a typical condiment from the Provence region of France most often associated with the Provençal dish soupe au pistou, which resembles minestrone and may include white beans, green beans, tomatoes, summer squash, potatoes, and pasta. The pistou is incorporated into the soup just before serving.\nGruyère cheese is used in Nice. Some regions substitute Parmesan cheese or Comté or sheep-cheese in Corsica .  Whatever cheese is used,  a \"stringy\" cheese is not preferred, so that when it melts in a hot liquid (like in the pistou soup, for instance), it does not melt into long strands.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArgentine chimichurri, a somewhat similar sauce made with parsley\nList of garlic dishes\nPersillade\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSoupe au Pistou, Wolfgang Puck\nSoupe au Pistou, Paula Wolfert Archived 2019-01-22 at the Wayback Machine\n</Document>"}

{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum\" page=\"\"/>\nA plum is a fruit of some species in Prunus subg. Prunus. Dried plums are often called prunes, though in the United States they may be labeled as 'dried plums', especially during the 21st century.\n\nPlums are likely to have been one of the first fruits domesticated by humans, with origins in East European and Caucasian mountains and China. They were brought to Britain from Asia, and their cultivation has been documented in Andalusia, southern Spain. Plums are a diverse group of species, with trees reaching a height of 5–6 metres (16–20 ft) when pruned. The fruit is a drupe, with a firm and juicy flesh.\nChina is the largest producer of plums, followed by Romania and Serbia. Japanese or Chinese plums dominate the fresh fruit market, while European plums are also common in some regions. Plums can be eaten fresh, dried to make prunes, used in jams, or fermented into wine and distilled into brandy. Plum kernels contain cyanogenic glycosides, but the oil made from them is not commercially available.\nIn terms of nutrition, raw plums are 87% water, 11% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and less than 1% fat. They are a moderate source of vitamin C but do not contain significant amounts of other micronutrients.\n\n\n== History ==\nPlums are likely to have been one of the first fruits domesticated by humans. Three of the most abundantly cultivated species are not found in the wild, only around human settlements: Prunus domestica has been traced to East European and Caucasian mountains, while Prunus salicina and Prunus simonii originated in China. Plum remains have been found in Neolithic age archaeological sites along with olives, grapes and figs. According to Ken Albala, plums originated in Iran. They were brought to Britain from Asia.\nAn article on plum tree cultivation in Andalusia (southern Spain) appears in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture.\nPlum cultivation is recorded in medieval monasteries in England. A garden with 'ploumes' and 'bulaces' is referred to by Chaucer.\nThe cultivation of plums increased during the 17th and 18th centuries. During this period greengages were given their English name and the Mirabelle plum became firmly established. Advances in the development of new varieties in England were made by Thomas Rivers. Two examples of River's work are the varieties Early Rivers and Czar. Both are still esteemed. The fame of the Victoria plum, first sold in 1844, has been put down to good marketing rather than any inherent quality.\n\n\n== Etymology and names ==\nThe name plum comes from Old English plūme \"plum, plum tree\", an evolution of plūmā, which was a common West Germanic loanword from Latin prūnum, which borrowed it from Ancient Greek προῦμνον proumnon, itself believed to be a loanword from an unknown language of Asia Minor. In the late 18th century, the word plum was used to indicate \"something sweet or agreeable\", probably in reference to tasty fruit pieces in desserts, as in the word sugar plum.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPlums are a diverse group of species. The commercially important plum trees are medium-sized, usually pruned to 5–6 metres (16–20 ft) height. The tree is of medium hardiness. Without pruning, the trees can reach 12 metres (39 ft) in height and spread across 10 metres (33 ft). They blossom in different months in different parts of the world; for example, in about January in Taiwan and early April in the United Kingdom.\nFruits are usually of medium size, between 2–7 centimetres (0.79–2.76 in) in diameter, globose to oval. The flesh is firm and juicy. The fruit's peel is smooth, with a natural waxy surface that adheres to the flesh. The plum is a drupe, meaning its fleshy fruit surrounds a single hard fruitstone which encloses the fruit's seed.\n\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n\n\tDifferent plum cultivars\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nJapanese or Chinese plums are large and juicy with a long shelf life and therefore dominate \n</Document>\n\n---\n\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Plum\" page=\"\"/>\nKelsey Christine Plum (born August 24, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Nicknamed \"Plum Dawg\", she is a three-time WNBA All-Star and was named the WNBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2022. Plum won gold medals with the United States in 3x3 basketball in 2020 and in 5x5 basketball in 2024. She is also the founder the Dawg Class basketball camp.\nBorn in Poway, California, Plum attended La Jolla Country Day School, where she was named a McDonald's All-American. She played college basketball at Washington, where she left as the NCAA Division I women's all-time leading scorer. In her senior season, Plum was named national player of the year and set the Division I single-season scoring record. She was selected first overall in the 2017 WNBA draft by the San Antonio Stars, later renamed the Las Vegas Aces. With the Aces, she won back-to-back WNBA championships in 2022 and 2023 and earned her first All-WNBA First Team selection in 2022.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPlum is the daughter of Katie and Jim Plum. Her mother was an accomplished volleyball player for the University of California, Davis. Her father earned All-American football honors and set the CIF San Diego Section career passing yardage mark at Helix High School in La Mesa, California, and went on to play football and baseball collegiately at San Diego State. Plum has two older sisters and a younger brother. Her sisters both followed in their mother's footsteps and played volleyball. Her oldest sister Kaitlyn played for UC Davis, while Lauren played for the University of Oregon and for USA Volleyball's Junior National Team. Her younger brother Daniel played football at UC Davis.\nShe went through fourth grade at a local Montessori school, but Plum, who has dyslexia, was bullied by her classmates, and was young for her class, felt unprepared to advance. This led to a transfer to Midland Elementary, a public school. Her mother Katie thought repeating fourth grade could be useful, but she left the decision to her daughter, and she agreed. The decision to repeat fourth grade did not go perfectly, since she didn’t like her teacher and her friends were in another class, so she asked to switch classes and was granted the request. However, even into high school, Plum felt like she didn’t belong. She has now said she hopes anyone facing situations like hers knows they can also get through it.\nPlum played volleyball at first, excelling in the USA Volleyball junior system, but when it came time for high school, she chose La Jolla Country Day School over Poway High School, where her sisters had attended, and Plum chose basketball over volleyball. La Jolla Country Day School is where Candice Wiggins played during her high school years as well.\n\n\n== High school ==\nDuring the course of her high school career, Plum scored a total of 2,247 points, averaging 19.9 points per game. She recorded 677 rebounds, assisted on 381 baskets, and had 370 steals. Over her four years, her team had a record of 103–22, which led to four section titles and the 2012 CIF Division IV state championship. Plum also played AAU basketball for San Diego Sol.\nPlum was selected to the 2013 WBCA High School Coaches' All-America Team. She participated in the 2013 WBCA High School All-America Game, hitting six of her eight field goal attempts, scoring 14 points.\nWhen it came time for college choices, Plum considered Maryland and Virginia on the east coast, and Cal, Gonzaga, Oregon and Washington on the west coast, then decided to accept the offer from Washington.\nPlum was named a McDonald's All-American. This qualified her to participate in the 2013 McDonald's All-American Girls Game. She was named Ms. Basketball by CalHiSports, an honor bestowed upon the best female high school basketball player in California. Prior winners include Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Courtney Paris, Candice Wiggins, and Diana Taurasi.\n\n\n== Colleg\n</Document>"}
