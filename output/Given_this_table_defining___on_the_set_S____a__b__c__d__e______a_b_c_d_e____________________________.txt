You are a general AI agent with the ability to call tools depending on the task. I will ask you a question.

Please attempt to answer this question by calling any of the provided tools. Once you feel you have a sufficient answer, 
finish your answer by simply outputting the exact answer, nothing more, nothing less. 

YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be:
- A number OR
- As few words as possible OR
- A comma separated list of numbers and/or strings
- If you feel you don't have the right tools for the job / don't know the answer, please output [TOOL_NEEDED] and indicate what tool you think might be useful to complete that task.

Guidelines:
- If asked for a number: Don't use commas or units (like $ or %) unless specified

Given this table defining * on the set S = {a, b, c, d, e}

|*|a|b|c|d|e|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|a|a|b|c|b|d|
|b|b|c|a|e|c|
|c|c|a|b|b|a|
|d|b|e|b|e|d|
|e|d|b|a|d|c|

provide the subset of S involved in any possible counter-examples that prove * is not commutative. Provide your answer as a comma separated list of the elements in the set in alphabetical order.
