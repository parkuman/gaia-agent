{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabazon_Dinosaurs\" page=\"\"/>\nCabazon Dinosaurs, formerly Claude Bell's Dinosaurs, is  a roadside attraction in Cabazon, California, featuring two enormous, steel-and-concrete dinosaurs named Dinny the Dinosaur and Mr. Rex. Located just west of Palm Springs, the 150-foot-long (46 m) Brontosaurus and the 65-foot-tall (20 m) Tyrannosaurus rex are visible from the freeway to travelers passing by on Southern California's Interstate 10. The roadside dinosaurs are best known for their appearance in the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985).\nSculptor and theme park artist Claude Bell began construction of the dinosaurs in 1964 with the goal of attracting more customers to his nearby restaurant, the Wheel Inn (open from 1958 to 2013). Dinny and Mr. Rex were completed in 1975 and 1986, respectively. Bell died in 1988 at age 91 and his family sold the property in the mid-1990s.   The new ownership turned the attraction into a roadside creationist museum in 2005, but creationist material has since been removed.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nClaude K. Bell (1896–1988) began his artistic career as a teenager sculpting teddy bears in the sand on the beach at Atlantic City, New Jersey in front of a wooden building that was shaped like an elephant.  Tips from passersby encouraged him, and before long he was making a living with his sand sculptures at state and county fairs across the country.: 71 \nIn 1947, Walter Knott hired him to create concrete sculptures of figures sitting on the benches at Knott's Berry Farm.: 71–75  Bell also operated the portrait studio at Knott's from 1951 to 1986.  He, his wife, and his daughter Wendy all worked there creating portraits of guests.\n\nThe site of the dinosaurs was purchased by Claude Bell in 1946 for $5,000 (equivalent to $75,034 in 2022). The land was leveled for him free of charge, as part of an agreement to let the state remove the gravel for development of an overpass on the freeway. Bell began living part-time on the land in 1952, and opened the Wheel Inn there in 1958.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nBell began construction of his first dinosaur, Dinny the Brontosaurus, in 1964. He took inspiration from a childhood visit to the Atlantic City Boardwalk, where he saw Lucy the Elephant: \"From then on I decided someday I would build something big like that elephant house.\"  Steel and cement for the project were salvaged from the freeway, after a flash flood rendered them unusable for official state construction. Bell was allowed to remove the materials in exchange for clearing them from state property.\nThe biomorphic building was first erected as steel framework over which an expanded metal grid was formed in the shape of a dinosaur. Bell worked with engineer Ralph Titus to weld steel girders into the \"ribs\" of the dinosaur and then to wrap the structure with wire to form the shape of the skin. According to Bell, \"Everything is shaped in wire – wrinkles in the neck, muscles in the legs.\" The wire was then sprayed with coats of shotcrete.\nBell was quoted in 1970 as saying the 45-foot-high (14 m), 150-foot-long (46 m) Dinny was \"the first dinosaur in history, so far as I know, to be used as a building.\" His original vision for Dinny was for the dinosaur's eyes to glow and mouth to spit fire at night, predicting, \"It'll scare the dickens out of a lot of people driving up over the pass.\" These two features, however, were not added.\nDinny was completed in 1975. At the time, the total cost of the project was estimated to be over $100,000 (equivalent to $543,847 in 2022). In 1986 Bell gave an estimated cost of $250,000 (equivalent to $667,426 in 2022). A 1999 article cited a cost of $300,000 (equivalent to $527,008 in 2022)\nBell had plans to construct a second dinosaur, a Tyrannosaurus rex, as early as 1970. \"It's taken so long for this first one,\" he said, \"because Ralph and I had to make our own special machinery – steel benders, an elevator out of an old truck, stuff like that--to get started. From here on it will be smooth sailing. We'll have our second d\n</Document>\n\n---\n\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_dinosaurs\" page=\"\"/>\nSince the coining of the word \"dinosaur\" in 1842, dinosaurs have served as a cornerstone of paleontology in popular culture. The non-avian dinosaurs featured in books, films, television programs, artwork, and other media have been used for both education and entertainment. The depictions range from the realistic, as in the television documentaries from the 1990s into the first decades of the 21st century, to the fantastic, as in the monster movies of the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe growth in interest in dinosaurs since the Dinosaur Renaissance has been accompanied by depictions made by artists working with ideas at the forefront of dinosaur science, presenting lively dinosaurs and feathered dinosaurs as these concepts were first being considered. Cultural depictions of dinosaurs have been an important means of translating scientific discoveries to the public.\nCultural depictions have also created or reinforced misconceptions about dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, such as inaccurately and anachronistically portraying a sort of \"prehistoric world\" where many kinds of extinct animals (from the Permian animal Dimetrodon to mammoths and cavemen) lived together, and dinosaurs lived lives of constant combat. Other misconceptions reinforced by cultural depictions came from a scientific consensus that has now been overturned, such as dinosaurs being slow and unintelligent, or the use of dinosaur to describe something that is maladapted or obsolete.\nDepictions are necessarily conjectural, because petrification and other fossilization mechanisms do not preserve all details. Any reconstruction is thereby an artist's view that, in order to stay within the limits of the best knowledge at the time, must necessarily be inspired by other pictures already scientifically proved.\n\n\n== History of depictions ==\n\n\n=== Early human history to 1900: Early depictions ===\n\nThe classical folklorist Adrienne Mayor has proposed that the profusion of literary descriptions and imagery of the griffin in Greek and Roman literature and art beginning in the 7th century BC to the 3rd century AD were influenced by observations and travelers' accounts of fossilized beaked dinosaur skeletons found in the Turpan and Junggar basins and Gobi Desert. She noted that according to Aristeas, Sophocles, Herodotus, and other ancient writers, griffins were said to inhabit and lay eggs in nests on the ground in the lands beyond the Issedonian territory of the region surrounding the Altai Mountains. Tales of these griffins traveled from east to west along the silk routes. Mayor draws connections to Protoceratops, a frilled dinosaur and Psittacosaur fossils and dinosaur nests with eggs conspicuous in the Gobi, sharing features associated with griffins: sharp beaks, four legs, claws, similar size, large eyes (or eye sockets in the case of the fossils), and the neck frill of Protoceratops, with large open holes, argued as inspiring descriptions of the griffin's large ears or wings. The palaeontologist Mark Witton notes in his blog that Mayor's suggestion ignores pre-Mycenaean accounts, and has not found favour with archaeologists including N. Wyatt and T.F. Tartaron. Many Near Eastern and Minoan artworks feature imaginary composite creatures, including quadrupeds with birds' heads but these were not called \"griffins\" and no writings link them to the strange beasts of Central Asia. There are no pre-Mycenaean or Minoan texts to relate bird-headed quadrupeds with classical griffins.\n\n \nAccording to Mayor, Navajos used to hold ceremonies and make offerings to dinosaur tracks in Arizona. Tridactyl tracks were also featured as decorations on the costumes and rock art of the Hopi and Zuni, probably influenced by such dinosaur tracks.\nThe scientific study of dinosaurs began in 1820s England. In 1842, Richard Owen coined the term dinosaur, which in his vision were elephantine reptiles. An ambitious promoter of his discoveries and theories, Owen was the driving force for the Crystal Palace d\n</Document>"}

{"wiki_results": "<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia\" page=\"\"/>\nWikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that is written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and the wiki software MediaWiki. Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history.\nInitially available only in English, Wikipedia exists in over 340 languages. The English Wikipedia, with over 7 million articles, remains the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 65 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average)  as of April 2024. As of May 2025, over 25% of Wikipedia's traffic comes from the United States, while Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia each account for around 5%.\nWikipedia has been praised for enabling the democratization of knowledge, its extensive coverage, unique structure, and culture. Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site. Although Wikipedia's volunteer editors have written extensively on a wide variety of topics, the encyclopedia has been criticized for systemic bias, such as a gender bias against women and geographical bias against the Global South (Eurocentrism). While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward. Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for up-to-date information about those events.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Nupedia ===\n\nVarious collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success. Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman. Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.\n\n\n=== Launch and rapid growth ===\nWikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 (referred to as Wikipedia Day) as a single English language edition with the domain name www.wikipedia.com, and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia. Its integral policy of \"neutral point-of-view\" was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia. Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.\n\nWikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004. Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made in China during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.\nCiting fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create \n</Document>\n\n---\n\n<Document source=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia\" page=\"\"/>\nThe English Wikipedia is the primary English-language edition of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. It was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on 15 January 2001, as Wikipedia's first edition.\nEnglish Wikipedia is hosted alongside other language editions by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization. Its content, written independently of other editions by volunteer editors known as Wikipedians, is in various varieties of English while aiming to stay consistent within articles. Its internal newspaper is The Signpost.\nEnglish Wikipedia is the most read version of Wikipedia, accounting for 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining percentage split among the other languages. The English Wikipedia has the most articles of any edition, at 7,010,821 as of June 2025. It contains 10.8% of articles in all Wikipedias, although it lacks millions of articles found in other editions. The edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 2021.\nEnglish Wikipedia, often as a stand-in for Wikipedia overall, has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced degree of commercial bias. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and ideological bias. While its reliability was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise in the late 2010s and early 2020s, having become an important fact-checking site. English Wikipedia has been characterized as having less cultural bias than other language editions due to its broader editor base.\n\n\n== Articles ==\n \nThe English Wikipedia surpassed six million articles on 23 January 2020. In November 2022, the total volume of the compressed texts of its articles amounted to 20 gigabytes.\nThe edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 2021 by Ser Amantio di Nicolao (Steven Pruitt) who as of that date is the user with the highest number of edits on the English Wikipedia, at over four million. Currently, there are 7,010,821 articles created with 938,818 files. The encyclopedia is home to 10.8% of articles in all Wikipedias (down from more than 50% in 2003). The English Wikipedia currently has 49,294,343 registered accounts of which 839 are administrators.\n\n\n== Bureaucracy ==\nEditors of the English Wikipedia have pioneered some ideas as conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include \"featured articles\", the neutral-point-of-view policy, navigation templates, the sorting of short \"stub\" articles into sub-categories, dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration, and weekly collaborations.\n\n\n== Wikipedians ==\n\nThe English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007, over a year since the millionth Wikipedian registered an account in February 2006.\nOver 1,100,000 volunteer editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times. Over 30,000 editors perform more than 5 edits per month, and over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits per month.\nOn 1 March 2014, The Economist, in an article titled \"The Future of Wikipedia\", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that \"[t]he number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.\" The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by \"sharp\" comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping \n</Document>"}

Besides being a fond memory from my childhood, they're an important part of video game history- the two main trilogies of episodes proved the viability of IBM-compatible PCs for action-based video games like Super Mario Bros., kickstarted the shareware distribution model, invented the industry's longest-running in-joke, and launched id Software, which went on to basically invent the first-person shooter genre as an encore. With the help of thorough reviews by Indrian, J Milburn, and IDV, the whole package of series page, 6.5 main episodes, and 1 awkward and overlooked pseudo-remake sequel is ready to go! --PresN 15:47, 28 October 2016 (UTC)\n\nSupport.

Whereas No. 90 Wing was formed to administer RAAF units in the Malayan Emergency, No. 91 Wing was the overarching organisation for RAAF units in the contemporaneous Korean War. At one stage this was going to be an FT nom, and I was just awaiting the main article's promotion to FA for that, but after some last-minute digging I found evidence that RAAF Transport Flight (Japan) was officially part of the wing for a short time, and therefore should technically be a part of this topic, meaning that we had more GAs than FAs -- that's how it goes sometimes... ;-) --Ian Rose (talk) 14:48, 22 August 2016 (UTC) \n\nSupport.
