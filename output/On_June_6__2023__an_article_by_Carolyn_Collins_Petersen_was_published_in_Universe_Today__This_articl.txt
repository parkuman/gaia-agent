Please attempt to answer this question by calling any of the provided tools. Once you feel you have a sufficient answer, 
finish your answer by simply outputting the exact answer, nothing more, nothing less. 

YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be:
- A number OR
- As few words as possible OR
- A comma separated list of numbers and/or strings
- If you feel you don't have the right tools for the job / don't know the answer, please output [TOOL_NEEDED] and indicate what tool you think might be useful to complete that task.

Guidelines:
- If asked for a number: Don't use commas or units (like $ or %) unless specified
